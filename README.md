# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms
## I have used five classifiers in this project the are Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression.

In my research i have observed and analysed that an automated system sometimes identifies fake news articles better than human do. The automated systems can play an important tool for identifying fake stories, articles, blogs, clicks which manipulate public opinion on social networking sites. The research in this area is based on two categories of algorithms, text-based, image-based and web scraping based.

Taking into need for the development of such fake news detection system, in this paper i have identified news articles as fake or real by using supervised machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes(NB), Random Forest(RF), Decision Tree(DT), SVM, Logistic Regression(LR). 

The feature extraction techniques, Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF–IDF), Count-Vectorizer (CV) are used to extract feature vectors from the textual content of articles. The effectiveness of a set of classifiers is observed when they predict the labels of the testing samples after learning the training data using these features extraction techniques. Various supervised ML models are ex
